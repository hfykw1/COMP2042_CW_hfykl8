### 1. Basic Maintenance
-	**Refactoring:** Encapsulating fields as the original code is not encapsulated so it is a violation of object-oriented key principles.
-	**Javadocs:** Javadoc is added to make the code easier to understand for any developers who view this code base.
-	**MVC (Model View Controller):** MVC is created by spliting main classes into three parts: Model, View and Controller. Benefits are ease of modification and low coupling.
-	**Rearranging Packages:** Before the packages were rearranged, all the classes were located in the same directory which makes it much harder to maintain. The classes are all separated into different packages based on their categories.
